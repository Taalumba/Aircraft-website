<h1 title="Header"; style="text-align:center; font-size:300%">Different Types of Aircraft</h1>

<p>An aircraft is a vehicle or machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. Common examples of aircraft include airplanes, helicopters, airships (including blimps), gliders, paramotors, and hot air balloons.</p>

<p>The human activity that surrounds aircraft is called aviation. The science of aviation, including designing and building aircraft, is called aeronautics. Crewed aircraft are flown by an onboard pilot, but unmanned aerial vehicles may be remotely controlled or self-controlled by onboard computers. Aircraft may be classified by different criteria, such as lift type, aircraft propulsion, usage and others <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft">(Wikipedia)</a>.</p>

<p style="color:red;">The Wright brothers are credited with creating the modern aircraft after the conducted the first powered flight on 17th December 1903.</p>

<h2 style="font-size:30px;">Aircraft categorization</h2>
<p>In the 100 + years since the advent of flight, several authorities have been established to regulate aviation and keep it safe. These authorities also provide guidelines on licensing and aircraft categorization. At present, one of the leading authorities in civil aviation is the United States of America Federal Aviation Authority (FAA).</p>

<p>Aircraft can be categorized in many different ways, depending on use, configuration and even administrative purpose. According to the FAA, an aircraft category refers to the “intended use or operating limits” of a particular group of aircraft. The classification of the aircraft refers to a group of aircraft with the same types of characteristics. For the purposes of pilot certification, the aircraft categories are:</p>

<p>Airplane – Engine-driven, fixed-wing aircraft</p>
<p>Lighter-Than-Air – Aircraft that uses a gas that is lighter than air in order to rise and remain in the air.</p>
<p>Powered Parachute – A powered type of aircraft that has a flexible wing, frame and wheels. The wing is not in the proper position or ready to provide lift until the aircraft is moving.</p>
<p>Rotorcraft – Flight is maintained by one or more spinning rotors.</p>
<p>Weight-Shift-Control – Also known as a hang glider. This aircraft contains a motor but is only directionally controlled by changes in the center of gravity rather than by control surfaces.</p>

<p>Let us look at each of these categories of aircraft in more depth.</p>
<hr>

<br>
<h3>1. Airplane</h3>
<p>Fixed-wing flying machines that are heavier-than-air, fall into the category of <b>airplane</b>. These types of planes achieve flight using wings that generate lift caused by the aircraft's forward airspeed and the shape of the wings. Fixed-wing aircraft are distinct from rotary-wing aircraft (in which the wings form a rotor mounted on a spinning shaft or "mast"), and ornithopters (in which the wings flap in a manner similar to that of a bird). The wings of a fixed-wing aircraft are not necessarily rigid; kites, hang gliders, variable-sweep wing aircraft and airplanes that use wing morphing are all examples of fixed-wing aircraft.</p>
<p>The most famous example of a fixed-wing airplane is the Boeing 737</p>

<h3>2. Lighter-Than-Air</h3>
<p>Otherwise known as <b>Aerostats</b>, these aircraft gain their lift through the use of a buoyant gas. Aerostats include unpowered balloons and powered airships. A balloon may be free-flying or tethered. The average density of the craft is lower than the density of atmospheric air, because its main component is one or more gasbags, a lightweight skin containing a lifting gas (including heated air as well as gases that have a lower density than air) to provide buoyancy, to other components such as a gondola containing equipment or people are attached. Especially with airships, the gasbags are often protected by an outer envelope.</p>

<h3>3. Powered Parachute</h3>
<p>A powered parachute, often abbreviated <b>PPC</b>, and also called a <b>motorized parachute</b> or <b>paraplane</b>, is a type of aircraft that consists of a parafoil with a motor and wheels. The FAA defines a powered parachute as a powered aircraft comprised of a flexible or semi-rigid wing connected to a fuselage so that the wing is not in position for flight until the aircraft is in motion. The fuselage of a powered parachute contains the aircraft engine, a seat for each occupant and is attached to the aircraft's landing gear.</p>

<h3>4. Rotorcraft</h3>
<p>A rotorcraft or rotary-wing aircraft is a heavier-than-air aircraft with rotary wings or rotor blades, which generate lift by rotating around a vertical mast. Several rotor blades mounted on a single mast are referred to as a rotor. <i>The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)</i> defines a rotorcraft as "supported in flight by the reactions of the air on one or more rotors". Rotorcraft generally include aircraft where one or more rotors provide lift throughout the entire flight, such as helicopters, autogyros, and gyrodynes. Compound rotorcraft augment the rotor with additional thrust engines, propellers, or static lifting surfaces. Some types, such as helicopters are capable of vertical takeoff and landing. An aircraft which uses rotor lift for vertical flight but changes to solely fixed-wing lift in horizontal flight is not a rotorcraft but a convertiplane.</p>

<h3>5. Weight-Shift-Control</h3>
<p>Weight-shift control as a means of aircraft flight control is widely used in hang gliders, powered hang gliders, and ultralight trikes. Control is usually by the pilot using their weight against a triangular control bar that is rigidly attached to the wing structure. The wing is mounted on a pivot above the trike carriage or hang glider harness allowing the weight-shift forces to produce changes in pitch and bank.</p>
