<hr>

<p style="background-color:dodgerblue;">If you decide to become a pilot, you will have to persue getting a pilots license; much like a drivers license, it does not have any major educational prerequisites. But it will take many hours of study and practical classes</p>

<p style="background-color:tomato;"> You will have to enroll in a flight school, and once you do, you will begin to have lessons in a small propeller powered aircraft such as a Cessna 172 (the most common plane for training).</p>

<p>There are several kinds of pilots licenses. First there is the <b>Student Pilot License (SPL)</b>, the <b>Private Pilot License (PPL)</b>, <b>Commercial Pilot License (CPL)</b>, and <b>Airline Transport Pilot License (ATPL)</b>.</p>

<p>In addition to these license types, there are specific certifications to use specific types and makes of aircraft, called <q>Class Ratings</q> and <q>Type Ratings</q>. We will look at these in more detail later. If you would like to get more detailed information about each type of pilot license, click on the name of it in the image below.</p>

<h2>Private Pilot Licence (PPL)</h2>

<p style="color:blue;">The first step will be passing your medical test to see if you are fit to fly. Once you pass this, you will be given your student pilots license so that you can begin your classes. On this license you can only conduct flights when accompanied by an instructor. You will have classroom lessons as well, called <q>Ground school</q> where you will learn flight theory and regulations.</p>

<img src="PPL_training.jpg" alt="Student and instructor" width="450" height="300" title="Student and instructor">

<p style="border:2px solid red;">After completing 40 hours of flight training - that is actual flight, you will be eligible to sit for your private pilots license exam. Note that the 40 hours of flight time are meaured from <q>push-back</q> to <q>parking break</q>. If you are successful, you will be awarded your <b>Private Pilots License (PPL)</b>. With this license you are entitled to fly alone in a specific class of aircraft (single propeller craft like the Cessna 172), for recreation and private use only, not commercial use.</p>

<h2>Instrument Rating and Multiengine Rating</h2>

<p><img src="Instrument_rating.jpg" alt="Instrument flight conditions" style="width:311.5px;height:175px; float:right" title="Instrument flight rules (IRF) conditions">After getting your PPL, if you want to proceed with a career in aviation, you will need a Commercial pilot license, so that you can fly passengers in exchange for money, and be employed. But before getting this license, you will need instrumenet rating and multiengine ratings. These are necessary prerequesites because:</p>

<br>
<pre>
1. You must be able to fly by using the instuments only (zero or low visibilty conditions)
2. Most commercial aircraft will have more than one engine
</pre>

<br>
<br>
<p>Here is an image of typical Instument flight rules conditions. Visibility is very low, and the pilot must depend on the instuments to navigate and land:</p>

<p>Before we continue, it is worth noting that there are a few large companies that produce and supply all of the aircraft in the world. The aviation industry is extremely capital intensive, and technical, which make it very difficult to break into. Most if not all aircarft manufacturers have only survived to this  day with significant government assitance, both in terms of legislation, and funding at certain points in their history. Here is a list of major manufacturers and some of their products.</p>

<p>Now lets move on to discuss the Commercial Pilots License (CPL)</p>

<h2>Commercial Pilots License (CPL)</h2>

<p>A commercial pilot licence (CPL) is a type of pilot licence that permits the holder to act as a pilot of an aircraft and be paid for his/her work. Different licenses are issued for the major aircraft categories: airplanes, airships, balloons, gliders, gyroplanes and helicopters. Depending on the jurisdiction these may all be on the same document. A CPL will typically have no expiry date. However, a valid medical certificate and valid rating will be required to use it. A pilot's ratings may be listed on the licence, including the types of aircraft that can be flown (single-engine or multiengine), whether flight under instrument flight rules is allowed (instrument rating), and whether instructing and examining of trainee pilots can be done (instructor or examiner rating).</p>

<img src="multiengine_craft.jpg" alt="Multi-engine aircraft" style="width:531px;height:300px" title="Multi-engine aircraft">

<p>The basic requirements to obtain the license and the privileges it confers are agreed internationally by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). However the actual implementation varies quite widely from country to country. According to ICAO,[citation needed] to be eligible for a commercial pilot license, the applicant must;

<pre style="font-family:times new roman; font-size:100%;">
- Be able to read, speak, write, and understand English
- Already hold a private pilot license
- Have received training in the areas of a commercial pilot
- Successfully complete the relevant written exams.
</pre>

In the United Kingdom, a pilot must have flown 200 hours for the issue of a CPL, including 100 hours as pilot in command. They must have completed a qualifying cross country flight of at least 300 nautical miles as pilot in command, including full stop landings at two aerodromes different from the departure aerodrome.</p>

<h2>Airline Transport Pilot License (ATPL)</h2>

<div style="background-color:black; color:white; padding:20px;">
<p>The airline transport pilot license (ATPL), or in the United States of America, an airline transport pilot (ATP) certificate is the highest level of aircraft pilot certificate. In the United States, those certified as airline transport pilots (unconditional) are authorized to act as pilot in command on scheduled air carriers' aircraft under CFR 14 Part 121. In the UK, pilots must hold an ATPL before they can be pilot in command on an aircraft with 9 or more passenger seats.</p>
</div>

<img src="Boeing-777X-1.jpg" alt="Boeing 777X" title="The Boeing 777X is currently the longest passenger aircraft" style="width:660px; height:400px;">

<p>Any pilot operating an aircraft for pay <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">must start by obtaining a commercial pilot licence (CPL)</span>. Airline transport pilot certifications do not have special endorsements, such as an instrument rating, as airline transport pilots must already possess knowledge and training in these areas. However, aircraft heavier than 12,500 pounds still require pilots to have a "type rating" (specific to the make and model of aircraft) certification.</p>

<h2 id="TR">Type Rating</h2>

<div class="rating">
<p>A type rating is an authorization entered on or associated with a pilot licence and forming part thereof, stating pilot's privileges or limitations pertaining to certain aircraft type. Such qualification requires additional training beyond the scope of the initial license and aircraft class training.</p>
</div>
<br>

<img src="full_simulator.jpg" alrt="Full flight simulator" title="Inside full flight simulator" style="width:744px; height:400px;">

<p>The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) specifies the international personnel licensing requirements, as documented in Annex 1 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation. Which aircraft require a type rating is decided by each country's civil aviation authority, in accordance with specifications outlined by ICAO.

<pre style="font-family:timesnewroman;">
ICAO stipulates that:

- Type Ratings should be established for aircraft with minimum crew of at least two pilots or when considered necessary by the Licensing Authority
- The applicant for a Type Rating must demonstrate the degree of skill required - including all normal flight procedures, 
  emergency procedures, instrument procedures (where applicable) as well as upset prevention and recovery.
</pre>
</p>

<p>As you come to the end of the initial part of your flight training, you will have to fly solo to prepare for exams and show you actually have the skills. One of the exercises you do is called <q>flying a traffic pattern</q> - which is multiple take offs and landings. Below you can read more about this activity.</p>
